Hardware tested:
    HackRF One for both transmission and reception

Wired cable testing:
    Two HackRF One radios were directly cabled together
    Transmission and reception was successful on frequencies
    in the range 87.9 MHz - 107.9 MHz.

ANT500 Antenna Testing:
    Frequencies tested: 89.9 MHz, 107.9 MHz
    Radio gain settings tested:
    TX
        RF Gain: 0 dB   or  14 dB
        IF Gain: 20 dB - 35 dB 
    RX
        RF Gain: 0 dB   or 14 dB
        IF Gain: 20 - 40 dB in 8 dB increments
        BB Gain: 20 dB


    Reception was not successful with TX RF gain and RX RF gain at 0 dB.
    Changing TX RF gain to 14 dB with RX RF gain at 0 dB allowed for line
    of sight reception of approximately 12 feet. The sound quality was noisy.

    The sound quality improved as the TX IF gain was increased from 20dB
    to 35 dB.

    Audio quality was good at TX RF gain 14 dB, IF gain 30 dB, up to 
    approximately 20 feet line of sight, and around 2 corners with
    open doorways about 10 feet from transmitter.

    The received audio quality improved by setting the RX RF gain to 14 dB.
    Increasing the RX IF gain from 20 dB to 32 dB allowed reception
    through two walls, doors closed, about 15 feet from the transmitter.

Summary:
    Transmission/reception successful with RF gain at 14 dB, and by
    increasing IF gain on both as well. The RX BB gain was held at
    the default 20 dB.


To Do:
    Research gain versus frequency for the HackRF One.
