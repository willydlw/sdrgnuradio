Directory contains some general examples to illustrate
concepts learned.

1. freq_shift.grc - Illustrates multiplying a 1kHz cosine
   source by a 2kHz cosine source produces a 3kHz output
   in the frequency domain. 

   Provides an example of how to use a WX GUI Notebook to
   show both the output FFT, Time signals in a tabbed form.


2. freq_shift_square.grc - Illustrates multiplying a square 
    wave signal by a sinusoidal signal in the time domain, shifts 
    the output signal in the frequency domain.

   Square waves are composed of an infinite series of frequency 
   peaks in the positive and negative directions
