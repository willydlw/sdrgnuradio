The subdirectories contain examples of gnuradio files that generate the following
date types:

byte, float, complex

and write that data to a file, using the gnuradio file sink block. 


File sink blocks save all data in binary form.


Each subdirectory also contains a python program example that demonstrates how
to read the binary data files and convert to the appropriate data type.
